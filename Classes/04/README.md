# Class 04

## Lesson

Today we will be covering the following topics:

* Strings ( https://processing.org/reference/String.html )
* Arrays ( https://processing.org/reference/Array.html )
* Converting variable types

## Homework

Produce a sketch that takes place entirely in the debug console.

This can be a piece of generative poetry, an animation, abstract illustration, etc...

Use at least one array of `String`s, and include at least one instance of using `random()` to produce an index number to fetch a random item from an array.

### Deliverables - Prior to class, Tuesday

  * A `.zip` file containing:
    * Your processing sketch
    * An `output.txt` file demonstrating what your project prints to the console. You can just copy and paste the output of the debug console and paste it into this `txt` file.
    * A `notes.txt` file of issues and questions you run into while making your project.
