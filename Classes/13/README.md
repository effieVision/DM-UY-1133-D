# Class 13

*Midterm Presentation Day!*

### Peer Review Format

* First, allow time for each member of your group to navigate the project on their own.

* Use your own to take notes about the feedback you receive, things you discover in this process, and ways to improve your project. You will email me this along with your midterm self assessment.

* Then demonstrate and show, then walk through how you built the piece. (5 Minutes)

* When feedback is being offered, allow each person to speak without interruption. You are to simply receive the information.

* Allow a couple of minutes for questions at the end of each project. (5 Minutes)

### Peer Review Framework

* Is the concept evident? Is it clear what this project is about? If so, why? If not, why not?

* Is the project well organized? Does the interaction sense? If so, why? If not, why not?

* Has attention been paid to spelling, alignment, image preparation/resolution, colors, sound?

* What are the strongest elements? What would you recommend to strengthen the project?

## Homework

### Documentation

Produce a number of still, or one still and one video capture, documenting your midterm. Post this to our class Instagram and our class Slack.

### Self Assessment Paper

Complete the Midterm Self Assessment:

Write a narrative midterm self-evaluation that is a bare minimum of 2 complete paragraphs.


```
In this narrative, address the following:

    * What do I know about this subject right now?

    * What has my journey looked like?

    * How has my learning effected my understanding of what I can create with these tools? How has my learning effected what I may be inspired to create?

    * What can I do to remain engaged, inspired and productive?
```

Synthesize what you are noticing in your notes, assignments, etc. with regard to your learning.

Your assessment should have a minimum of three citations from lectures, weekly discussions, code or concepts, and/or tutorials.
