## Homework

#### Assignment 01.b: "Digitize the Old Guard!"

Pick a piece of art or design to "recreate" or "reinterpret" using the shape primitives and color techniques we covered in class.

#### Details and Format

The piece you choose to recreate can be in any medium– painting, posters, book covers, sculpture, choreography, digital art, as long as we can clearly understand, visually, your take on "recreating" or "reinterpreting" it.

Your canvas will be **1080px square**.

You will rely extensively on the Processing [reference site](https://processing.org/reference/). Browse it and see if you find any other shape functions that will help you create your piece.

Remember the flow of operations: style functions like `fill()` are set **prior** to the geometry's draw function.

Remember some draw functions treat "positioning" differently. For example, if your ellipse is not showing up in the place you expect, refer back to the `ellipseMode()`s we covered.

Comment your code extensively. Try the different types of comments we went over in class, and the keyboard shortcut, `Command + /`.

#### Deliverable – for Monday 09.09.19

By email, as a `.zip`:

- Your processing sketch `.pde`. If your sketch is named `KlimtRemake.pde`, it should be contained in a folder named `KlimtRemake`.
- One or multiple images of the piece you are referencing.
- One bitmap `.png` of the final output of your sketch.
- One vector `.pdf` of the sketch– remember, this may be formatted incorrectly compared to what you see in processing and your `.png`– that is OK.
- A `notes.txt` file of any questions or problems you run into. Write these **as** you are making your sketch.

## Post-class Communique

```
Hi class!

You can find the complete homework instructions in our updated class repo at:
https://github.com/effieVision/DM-UY-1133-D/tree/master/Classes/02

Also, for those of you who missed the first class- please review the material in the “Classes/01” folder, complete the “ASCII Art” assignment, and email that to me:
https://github.com/effieVision/DM-UY-1133-D/tree/master/Classes/01

Lastly,
I would like for us to maintain a class Instagram account for documenting our projects– we will all be given the login information so we can all post to that account.
Attached is a screenshot of some former students’ projects for today’s “Recreate / Reinterpret” assignment.
If anyone has issues or objections to using the Instagram app, please reach out to me via email.

Thanks!
```
