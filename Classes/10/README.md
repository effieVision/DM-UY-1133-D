Today we will be briefly covering a variety of various tools and topics you can think about integrating into your midterm project.

### Midterm Prompt

For the midterm, the one thing we will avoid is making a "game"– let's think about these tools and what they can do more broadly.

Your assignment is to use the skills we've built up over the past few weeks to create an experience *about something you care about*.

Use these tools to express or explore an idea or opinion about a topic– imagine an abstract representation of gentrification, gender, the way social media makes you feel, food deserts, politics, cancel culture, choose to focus specifically on a certain emotion or sensation through finely-tuning a specific aesthetic, etc...

Pursue something that you are excited about and will be proud to share!

## Homework

Begin experimenting with techniques and ideas you'd like to pursue for your midterm. Save those experiments and bring them to class next week where I will work with each of you individually on your concept and implementation of that concept.
