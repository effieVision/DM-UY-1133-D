    <p>Trick-or-treating is a Halloween ritual custom for children and adults in many countries. Children in costumes travel from house to house, asking for treats with the phrase "Trick or treat". The "treat" is usually some form of candy, although
      in some cultures money is used instead.</p>

    <p>The "trick" refers to a threat, usually idle, to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given.</p>
