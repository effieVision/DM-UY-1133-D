# Week 06 Class A

## In-Class

Today will be an in-class work day to continue or begin your midterm project.

We will start by going around the room and sharing our idea or ideas for the assignment, and give each other feedback.

Afterwards we will start our studio-class work and I will review the experiments and prototypes you produced over the weekend.

## Homework Format

Continue work on your project- you should have made some major first steps by next class.
