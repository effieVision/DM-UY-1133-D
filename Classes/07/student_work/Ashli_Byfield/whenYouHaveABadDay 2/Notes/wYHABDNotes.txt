SO MANY THINGS WENT WRONG!!!

1. I was initially trying to create a quiz, but the texts would overlap.... I'' put the code for that in another .txt doc (it is unfinished because I gave up and started something new)
2. I can't seem to position anything in the center, everything is to the right and cut off by my screen
3. When I change to state 1, state 0 still shows 
4. How do I make image size larger?
5. When I try to save as png, animal image is severely delayed...
