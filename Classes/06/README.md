# Week 3 - Class B

Today we will review **Interaction** with the mouse and keyboard.

We will spend the latter part of class as work-time for you to get started implementing or exploring those interaction methods for your assignment.

If there is time we will also cover video screen-capture on MacOS using Quicktime.

## Homework

Your homework is to create an experience (art piece, game, etc...) focusing specifically on user interaction with either the Mouse or Keyboard.

(If your main interaction is one input method, feel free to also include events from the other, but focus specifically on the main one you chose.)

#### Format

* Your sketch will be `1080x1080` pixels.

#### Homework Deliverable

* A `.zip` file containing:
 * Your sketch in a folder
 * A `notes.txt` file of issues or questions.
 * A `.png` image of your sketch. _It may make sense to use the `keyPressed()` event to trigger the `save()` function to capture a frame of your sketch mid-interaction._

* Post the `.png` of your sketch to the class Instagram, or, ideally, use screen-recording software to post a video.
