One of the problems I ran into was making curved vectors.
I did not know how to make the mouth curved even though I followed the reference code.
So I ended up making a straight face.
Another issue I had was filling the pupils black.
I kept accidentally filling up the whole eye black.
I fixed it by setting a fill function in front of each ellipse function.
