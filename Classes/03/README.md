### Lesson + Homework

Update your first "Recreate / Reinterpret" sketch by using variables.

Think about the logical places you can use variables to cut down on repeated input of the same value throughout the entire sketch.

**Remember:** `Ints` and `Floats` operate differently, and some math such as division will behave differently as well.

**Please:** Follow `"camelCaps"` capitalization. As we progress further into writing our own functions, classes, and typesâ€“ capitalization not only a serves a functional purpose, it is an important habit to make your complex code more legible.
