Hello Creative Coders!

Attached is a PDF version of the syllabus– this will be updated over the
next few days and eventually hosted on our class Github account.

The weekly breakdown of topics and assignments up until
the midterm ARE finalized– I will be tuning our post-midterm switch to P5.js.

::: HOMEWORK – DUE BEFORE CLASS ON THURSDAY 09/05 :::

- Your homework assignment is to use Atom to produce a piece of ASCII art.
- Your composition should be 80 characters wide by 30 lines tall.
- Pick an anonymous pseudonym (handle / screen name / pen-name).
- a. Include that name somewhere in your composition
  b. Save your artwork as "YourPseudonymHere.nfo" (obvs use yours)
  c. email the work to me PRIOR to class at: effie.vision@gmail.com

This piece can be ANYTHING. Illustrative, poetic, abstract... go for it!

* NOTE: When making your piece- INDENTING WITH TABS is not the same as SPACES...
I suggest you use "spaces" for the negative space / positioning in your piece:
you will see why in Thursday's class >:-}

::: ALSO FOR NEXT CLASS :::

Please have the Processing IDE downloaded and running on your computer-
https://processing.org/download/

::: LASTLY :::

As we saw in class today, we have students with a WIDE range of experiences.
It is important that we operate in a way respectful to that diversity.

Those of you who have programming experience:
I expect you to focus on what we are learning from assignment to assignment-
there are ways to push your technical capabilities and STILL stay on topic
with what the entire class is learning, together. I promise!

I'm looking forward to this semester with all of you– see ya Thursday!
